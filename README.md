<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was developed during the Kode With Klossy Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning curriculum, which uses a model trained in the CreateML framework that classifies images of food and ingredients to identify potential recipes that can be made. The interface was created using Swift and the SwiftUI framework in XCode.
